# Asteroid diameter prediction
What all is out there in space is still a mystery. Scientists are always trying to search for something new in space. While a lot is expected to be discovered, let us look at what has been found.

#### ASTEROIDS !! 
They have always been interesting as current theory suggest that asteroids are planetisimals, the building blocks of planets that were never incorporated into one of the eight planets in our solar system.

- So what exactly are asteroids? 

By definition asteroids are small, rocky objects that orbit the Sun. Although asteroids orbit the Sun like planets, they are much smaller than planets.

- Why are they important? 

Well they may tell us about the origins of our solar system, They may help us understand more about the origin of life, We may want to mine near-earth asteroids for metals, They may someday threaten to collide with Earth and many more such reasons.

These questions are very important from our perspective because if the asteroid is made up of some valuable metal, the larger it is the more beneficial it may be to us. Also if the asteroid is large and near to the Earth it may very well prove to be fatal to the planet. This leads to another question which is how do we know which asteroid is large enough to be mined for metals if they do exists or large enough to be dangerous to the planet?
Determining the size of the asteroid may lead us to some conclusion about the impact of the asteroid. Size of the asteroid is measured in terms of diameter and predicting the diameter of the asteroid may help us in our quest of approximating the dangers or benefits the asteroids presents to the planet
